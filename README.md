# ADS1115_for_RaspberryPi
I rewrote the ptap_ads1115 library in C for a Raspberry Pi Zero. Two pressure transducers will be used, so this library reads from two different channels on one ADC. This was written for [Cal Poly Space Systems](https://github.com/CalPolySpaceSystems).

I am always trying to learn from my mistakes, so [provide feedback or suggestions for improvement](https://github.com/BenClark1/ADS1115_for_RaspberryPi/issues). Your input is appreciated.
